# 3D-Modeller
This 3D Modeller project provides a robust and intuitive environment for creating and manipulating 3D geometric shapes such as cubes, spheres, and composite figure. Developed using Python, it leverages the PyOpenGL library to interact with the OpenGL API, delivering a real-time interactive experience for rendering 3D graphics. The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) is utilized for window management and handling user inputs, which include mouse clicks and keyboard events to select and manipulate objects within the 3D space. This tool enables users to explore fundamental 3D modeling techniques, such as translation and rotation of objects, making it an ideal platform for developers aiming to prototype and refine 3D scenes efficiently.
